of the cylinders on each stroke of the cycle. A further
increase in power and smoothness is obtained in engines
of 6, 8,12, and 16 cylinders, which are arranged in either
a straight line or two banks assembled in the form of a V.
Carburation
Air is mixed with the vapour of the petrol in the
carburettor. To prevent the air and the carburettor from
becoming too cold for successful evaporation of the fuel,
the air for the carburettor is usually taken from a point
close to a heated part of the engine. Modern carburet-
tors are fitted with a so-called float-feed chamber and a
mixing or spraying chamber. The first is a small cham-
ber in which a small supply of petrol is maintained at a
constant level. The petrol is pumped from the main tank
to this chamber, the float rising as the petrol flows in
until the desired level is reached, when the inlet closes.
/â€™ The carburettor is equipped with such devices as accel-
erating pumps and economizer valves, which automati-
cally control the mixture ratio for efficient operation
under varying conditions. Level-road driving at constant
speed requires a lower ratio of petrol to air than that
needed for climbing hills, for acceleration, or for start-
ing the engine in cold weather. When a mixture ex-
tremely rich in petrol is necessary, a valve known as the
choke cuts down the air intake, permitting large quanti-
ties of unvaporized fuel to enter the cylinder.
